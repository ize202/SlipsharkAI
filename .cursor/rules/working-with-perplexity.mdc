Authorizations
​
Authorization
string
header
required
Bearer authentication header of the form Bearer <token>, where <token> is your auth token.

Body
application/json
​
model
string
required
The name of the model that will complete your prompt. Refer to Supported Models to find all the models offered.

​
messages
object[]
required
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.


Hide child attributes

​
messages.content
string
required
The contents of the message in this turn of conversation.

​
messages.role
enum<string>
required
The role of the speaker in this turn of conversation. After the (optional) system message, user and assistant roles should alternate with user then assistant, ending in user.

Available options: system, user, assistant 
​
max_tokens
integer
The maximum number of completion tokens returned by the API. The number of tokens requested in max_tokens plus the number of prompt tokens sent in messages must not exceed the context window token limit of model requested. If left unspecified, then the model will generate tokens until either it reaches its stop token or the end of its context window.

​
temperature
number
default:
0.2
The amount of randomness in the response, valued between 0 inclusive and 2 exclusive. Higher values are more random, and lower values are more deterministic.

Required range: 0 < x < 2
​
top_p
number
default:
0.9
The nucleus sampling threshold, valued between 0 and 1 inclusive. For each subsequent token, the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. We recommend either altering top_k or top_p, but not both.

Required range: 0 < x < 1
​
search_domain_filter
any[]
Given a list of domains, limit the citations used by the online model to URLs from the specified domains. Currently limited to only 3 domains for whitelisting and blacklisting. For blacklisting add a - to the beginning of the domain string. Only available to users in Tier-3.

​
return_images
boolean
default:
false
Determines whether or not a request to an online model should return images. Only available to users in Tier-2.

​
return_related_questions
boolean
default:
false
Determines whether or not a request to an online model should return related questions. Only available to users in Tier-2.

​
search_recency_filter
string
Returns search results within the specified time interval - does not apply to images. Values include month, week, day, hour.

​
top_k
number
default:
0
The number of tokens to keep for highest top-k filtering, specified as an integer between 0 and 2048 inclusive. If set to 0, top-k filtering is disabled. We recommend either altering top_k or top_p, but not both.

Required range: 0 < x < 2048
​
stream
boolean
default:
false
Determines whether or not to incrementally stream the response with server-sent events with content-type: text/event-stream.

​
presence_penalty
number
default:
0
A value between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. Incompatible with frequency_penalty.

Required range: -2 < x < 2
​
frequency_penalty
number
default:
1
A multiplicative penalty greater than 0. Values greater than 1.0 penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. A value of 1.0 means no penalty. Incompatible with presence_penalty.

Required range: x > 0
​
response_format
object
Enable structured outputs with a JSON or Regex schema. Refer to the guide here for more information on how to use this parameter. Only available to users in Tier-3.

Response

200
application/json

application/json
OK
​
id
string
An ID generated uniquely for each response.

​
model
string
The model used to generate the response.

​
object
string
The object type, which always equals chat.completion.

​
created
integer
The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the completion was created.

​
citations
any[]
Citations for the generated answer.

​
choices
object[]
The list of completion choices the model generated for the input prompt.


Hide child attributes

​
choices.index
integer
​
choices.finish_reason
enum<string>
The reason the model stopped generating tokens. Possible values include stop if the model hit a natural stopping point, or length if the maximum number of tokens specified in the request was reached.

Available options: stop, length 
​
choices.message
object
The message generated by the model.


Show child attributes

​
choices.delta
object
The incrementally streamed next tokens. Only meaningful when stream = true.


Show child attributes

​
usage
object
Usage statistics for the completion request.


Hide child attributes

​
usage.prompt_tokens
integer
The number of tokens provided in the request prompt.

​
usage.completion_tokens
integer
The number of tokens generated in the response output.

​
usage.total_tokens
integer
The total number of tokens used in the chat completion (prompt + completion).
